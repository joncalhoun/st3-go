# st3-go

This repo contains code I used to build my ST3 plugins for Go. I am lazy and don't know python well so its all in one repo for now to make including it in my plugins easier. If you want to help me clean things up I'm more than willing to work with you on it üëç

## Testing

Run this:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover
```
